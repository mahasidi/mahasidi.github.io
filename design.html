        <figcaption>I created a personal photo journal to document my journey of self-exploration during my first year of college and I used 
            this as an outlet to remind myself of what's most meaningful to me. Amist the chaos and confusion of college life, 
            this journal gave me an opportunity hit pause on life and truly reflect on my surroundings and how far I've come. All illustrations
            were created using Adobe Illustrator, the page layout was organized using Adobe InDesign, and all photos were taken by me.

            <figcaption>For this project, I was asked to create a poster to advertize a designer hypotheticaly coming to my city. 
                I chose a German designer named Wilhelm Deffke, who is mainly known for his astonishing logos. The particular work I analyzed
                is called "Manoli Gold". This project features a digital
                poster, a mockup of a paper poster, and a mock up of a tote design. The illustrations were done in Adobe Illustrator, the framing of
                the poster was done in Adobe InDesign, and the mock-ups were done in Adobe Photoshop.
