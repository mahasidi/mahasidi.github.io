          <h3>Black Islamic Association</h3>
          <p>
            BIA is an organization that is dedicated to providing a space for
            the underrepresented and often overlooked Black Muslim community. My
            fellow co-founders and I felt that it was important to provide this
            space to ensure that every student has an understanding and
            relatable support system on campus.

            Immigrant Justice: Fighting for Asylum Seekers through Research and
            Writing
          </h3>
          <p>
            In a program led by the Northeastern University School of Law
            Immigrant Justice Clinic, I was able to educate myself on domestic
            law regarding immigration (specifically asylum) and directly aid an
            asylum applicant. I contributed to this project by creating a report
            of the conditions in the home country that demonstrated that the
            asylum seeker is unsafe in that country.

          <h3>PeaceJam Confrence</h3>
          <p>
            My team and I presented at the PeaceJam Southeastern conference in
            Tallahassee, Florida. Our goal for this presentation was to raise
            awareness about the refugee crisis globally. My first-hand research
            consisted of visiting the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin,
            Georgia. With the help of El Refugio (A Georgia-based organization
            that provides support to individuals who‚Äôve family members have been
            detained), I was able to converse with men who were being detained
            and awaiting their trial. In the presentation, I was able to amplify
            their voices and call for action.
