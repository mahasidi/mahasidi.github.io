                      underrepresented and often overlooked Black Muslim community. My fellow co-founders
                       and I felt that it was important to provide this space to ensure that every student 
                       has an understanding and relatable support system on campus.

                          Immigrant Justice: Fighting for Asylum Seekers through Research and Writing</figcaption>
                        <figcaption>In a program led by the Northeastern University School of Law Immigrant Justice Clinic, I was able to 
                          educate myself on domestic law regarding immigration (specifically asylum) and directly aid an asylum applicant. I contributed to this project
                           by creating a report of the conditions in the home country that demonstrated that 
                          the asylum seeker is unsafe in that country.

                        <figcaption>My team and I presented at the PeaceJam Southeastern conference in Tallahassee, Florida.
                          Our goal for this presentation was to raise awareness about the refugee crisis globally. My first-hand research consisted of visiting the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia. 
                           With the help of El Refugio (A Georgia-based organization that provides support to individuals who‚Äôve family members have been detained), 
                           I was able to converse with men who were being detained and awaiting their trial. In the presentation, I was able to amplify
                           their voices and call for action.
